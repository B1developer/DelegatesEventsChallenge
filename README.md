# DelegatesEventsChallenge

Challenge: Create a simple console application that simulates a stock market tracker. The program should:

  1. Have a Stock class that tracks the stock price and raises an event when the price changes significantly (e.g., more than 5%).
  2. Create a StockAlert class that listens for changes in the stock price and displays an alert when a significant price change occurs.
  3. Use delegates and events to implement this functionality.
